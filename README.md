# Work Day Scheduler!
---
Inside the master branch I have all the code from the index file, css and javascript to the index for the Schedule!
---
I tried to get creative and add a pop up window if you try to save over a already added time but I was struggling with it and almost scractched it until I ened up figuring it out!
---
The schedule is responsive and you can add your own appointments for different times and shows the date for today! I have a window pop up that warns you when about to save over a currently saved item!. IT also changes colors when times already passed and when its the current time and when future time is still available.
